Introduction
============

Enhancing your page with microdata helps search-engines like google better find and display your pages.

This extension is build in addition to the ``EXT:calendarize``. It can also be used in many other ways.
The ViewHelper-structure gives you the full control over the data you provide.
So you can show your user a nice human readable version and more detailed version to the search engine.
